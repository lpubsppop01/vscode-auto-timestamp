```

If this extension does not work, please check the followings:
- The Line Limit setting is `5` lines from the beginning of the file by default, so it may be too small for your file.
- There is also the setting of the target file name (Filename Pattern), and `.vscode/settings.json` is ignored by default.
  - The default value changed in version 0.0.5. If you have been using 0.0.4 or earlier and have changed this setting, please check it.
- This extension does not work if your VS Code Auto Save setting is `afterDelay`.
